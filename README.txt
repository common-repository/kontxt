Kontxt is the web's leading interactive platform. Use Kontxt to increase engagement, boost traffic, keep readers, and build your audience.

== Description ==

[Kontxt](https://kontxt.io/) adds an interactive layer to the web. Enrich websites with highlights, comments, polls, @mentions to page parts, deep links, and control who and how visitors can interact with your sites. 

Add highlights to your website and make comments and polls for yourself and others that have shareable deep links that scroll directly to them. @Mention people to send an email notification with a deep link. Use the side bar pop-over to let you and your visitors efficiently view all the activity on the page. Navigate quickly between highlights locally with next and previous arrow buttons, and globally with the small placeholders that span the left side of the page. Enable these features just for yourself to emphasize content, draw attention, and add additional context to page parts, or let your users respond to your highlights, comments, and polls, or let them make their own highlights, and interact with other visitors annotations, too.

The Kontxt for WordPress plugin lets site owners and developers easily add Kontxt to their websites, which can be used along side or in place of the default WordPress comment system.
